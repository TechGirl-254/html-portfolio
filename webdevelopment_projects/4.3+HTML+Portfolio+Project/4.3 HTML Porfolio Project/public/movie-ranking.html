<h3>La Premiere Chef D'ochestre</h3>
<p>
    This is the best movie I have watched.It revloves around the life of Antonia Brico, the first woman to ever become an ocherstra's conductor. It's a tale of passion, and ambition, and determiniation that motivates me to the core.

<h3>Medici</h3>
<p>
    Medici isn't necessarily a movie, it's a series, but my oh my is it 
    amazing. Forget the drama in Game of Thrones, Medici is where it's all at. 
    Understaning Florentine culture, watching ancient art come to life, 
    watching the life of a dinasty unfold, it's epic.

<h3>The Fault in Our Stars</h3>
<p>
    For some reason, I just can't get enough of the emotions in this movie. I 
    mean, whoever wrote the script, is a genius. The poetry in it, the choice 
    of characters, the plot twist, I can't help but fall in love.
