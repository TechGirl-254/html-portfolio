<h3>The Fault in Our Stars</h3>
<p>
    For some reason, I just can't get enough of the emotions in this movie. I 
    mean, whoever wrote the script, is a genius. The poetry in it, the choice 
    of characters, the plot twist, I can't help but fall in love.

<h3>Medici</h3>
<p>
    Medici isn't necessarily a movie, it's a series, but my oh my is it 
    amazing. Forget the drama in Game of Thrones, Medici is where it's all at. 
    Understaning Florentine culture, watching ancient art come to life, 
    watching the life of a dinasty unfold, it's epic
</p>
<h3>Downton Abbet</h3>
<p>
    This is also a series, set up in Elizabethan England. My goodness am I 
    in love with the character Lady Violet Crowley. Her quick wit and 
    eloquence is unparalled.
